## Purpose

The purpose of this Markdown Document is to record the methods for extracting soils data for the redcedar GPS points.

Unfortunately, I had to do this with windows because the soils data I am first exploring are provided in arcmap database formats (.gdb). 

## Additional Considerations

* Possible options to move forward include: 
  + Maybe I could actually convert them in ArcMap to another format? 
  + **Extracting data from rasters for gps points and exporting into .csv format using arcGIS for analyses in OSX.**
  + Look for alternative soils data that are in another format?
  
Below are the methods I used to extract the soils data for the GPS points.


## Download Data

  * Download gSSURGO data from the [USDA Geospatial Data Gateway](https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov/GDGHome_DirectDownLoad.aspx)
    + click on the link to 'Soils' - Redirects you to a the [NRCS Box Folder](https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/soils)
    + I downloaded OR and WA data from the folder 'October 2021 gSSURGO by State'.
      + Note the zip files for each state was ~500MB


Working with gSSURGO data is kind of awkward because you have to join tables of interest to the base raster file before you can map those table variables.
  
  
## Wrangle Shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro  

### Add Data Layers

  * Add Data
      + Add MapunitRaster_10m for each state, rename content based on state
        + In the Map Tab of ArcGIS Pro, click 'add data', browse to downloaded folder (geodatabase - .gbd), find raster file in list
          + Note I had trouble finding it in windows explorer on the second attempt to complete these instructions
        + Add CSV with iNat GPS - Add GPS points wrangled from data downloaded from iNaturalist project
          + Note ArcGIS Pro was doing a weird thing where after opening gps csv, it wouldn't recognize lat/long columns the next time I tried to add it as a layer.
            + Copy original GPS file as a new file specifically for use in ARCGIS
          + If you add csv as table with 'add data' button in Map Tab of ArcGIS Pro, you can then right click the layer and select 'display XY data'
            + It will add a layer with your points
          
### Subset Data        
     
  * Subset Data (needed to avoid insufficient memory error)
      + Add soils polygons for each state MUPOLYGON
        + Again, click 'add data' browse to .gdb and then find MUPolygon in list. 
        + Rename polygon for each state (e.g. WA MUPolygon)
      + Use select by location for Tree GPS points (find tool in Map Tab of ArcGIS Pro)
        + Input features - gps.csv
        + Relationship - Intersect
        + Selecting Features - WA MUPOLYGON
        + Selection type - New Selection
      + Save selected
        + Right click point layer -> Selection -> Make layer from selected features
        + Rename layer (e.g. Washington GPS Points)
      
### Join Data     
    
   * Join Data (Follow gSSUGO User Guide for joining Data) - complete for each state
      + Muaggatt data
        + right click raster -> select Joins and relates -> Add Join
          + Input: OR MapunitRaster_10m
          + Input Join Field: MUKEY
          + Join Table: OR Mapunit Aggregated Attribute (muaggatt)
          + Join Table Field: MUKEY
      + Repeat with Component TAble
          + This time use Input Join Field 'MUPOLYGON.MUKEY or VAT_OR MApunitRaster_10m.MUKEY'
          + Might not have MUKEY file for join field, instead use 'Map Unit Key'
      + (Optional) Not recommended though -too much data - Repeat with Chorizon Table
          + Use Component.cokey and Component Key as Join Fields
      + (Optional) Note the same process can be followed for adding table data to the shape file (MUPOLYGON).
        + Directions for using shapefiles are available here [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/zGfT1v8Fmug)
            + This process also involves Dissolve to Dissolve Shapefile by MUKEY - split rows with same MUKEY values?

### Extract data for points     
     
  * Extract raster data for points
      + followed directions here https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000022163
        + Note need to subset data to avoid 'ERROR 010005: unable to allocate memory'
        + Extract Values to Points (Search to find tool) - you will need Liscense for Spatial Analyst Tools)
        + Input Point Feature - Washington GPS Points
        + Input Raster - WA MapunitRaster_10m 2
        + Output Point Features - extract_GPS_Washington
          + Check 'Interpolate values at the point locations' (note, I am not sure if this is the best choice)
          + Check 'Append all the input raster attributes to the output point features'


### Export Data to table
        
  * Export GPS data with soils data as .csv
        + Right click layer created above (Extract_GPS_Washington) -> Data -> Export Table
          + Input rows - Extract_GPS_Washington 
          + browse to folder to save file (e.g. redcedar/serverfiles/data)
          + be sure to add '.csv' to end of file name (e.g. Washington_GPS_Soils_Data_muaggatt_component.csv)
      
### Visualize Shape Files

  * (Optional) Visualize raster data
      + Change symbology of raster files
        + right click layer and select symbology
          + select classify then change field to bedrock depth or other variable of interest.
