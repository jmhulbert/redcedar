## Welcome

Western Redcedar Dieback Map data analyses

The purpose of this repository is to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses conducted with data collected in the [Western Redcedar Dieback Map](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) project. Anyone is welcome to collaborate in the analyses of these data.

The overall approach is to model empirical data collected by community scientists with ancillary environmental data (climate, topographic, and soils) to identify important predictors of western redcedar dieback.

Please check back again soon for more information about this repo. In the mean time, please contact JM Hulbert at hulbe@wsu.edu if you're interested in contributing.

More information about methods to help address the pressing environmental issues affecting our forests is available at the [Forest Health Watch](https://foresthealth.org/) website.
